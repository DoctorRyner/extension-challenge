# eco.mio Browser Extension

## Rainer Rainkhardt's note on running and testing the project

### Running the Python API

1. Go to the `api` folder
2. Run `docker compose up --build` (http://localhost:8000)
3. Wait for the docker to build and load
4. Run `./run manage migrate`
5. Run `./run manage migrate pages`

If you want to check the database content create a superuser with `./run manage createsuperuser` and go to `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

P.S.

I wanted the dummy sustainability score to be random and I decided generating it JIT instead of pulling it out of the database.

### Testing the whole extension

To test the project you need to build and install the extension, after that just go to the `https://www.skyscanner.com/` or `https://www.kayak.com/` and
you'll see that to a destination input an eco.mio widget will be mounted. The widget is a button that highlights itself and the destination input element with a color
representing sustainability score. Clicking on this eco.mio button will expand it to a small window with sustainability score data displayed.

## Description

This repo contains base code for the eco.mio hiring challenge. What you are looking at is a stub version of a browser extension. Learn about how to get started below. But first, here is the task:

### Main task

Build a browser extension that augments the user experience for a travellers performing an air or rail search on https://skyscanner.com and https://kayak.com. This extension should do the following:

- Read out the user's destination from the site
- Provide the user in an intuitive way with dummy sustainability information of their trip
  - The data can be anything, e.g. a sustainability score of the destination
  - The data must be fetched from a DB through a backend app (ideally written in Django)
- Save each search to the database (origin, time of search, data displayed to the user)

Bonus points will be awarded for:

- Great UI
- Tooltip on the element with some more (dummy) information

Solve the task as if you were working on it in a professional environment.

### Additional Task

You will find a class `DOMElement.ts` in the src directory. Give feedback about it as if you were doing a code review. Use comments in the code for this.
You may also alter it and use it for your own implementation.

### Questions and Submission

if you have any questions, contact Mario at m@ecomio.com. Once you are done with the task notify Mario via email (m@ecomio.com) and include the link to your repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Installed Chrome or Edge Browser
2. NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (for npm)

---

## Installation

1. Create your own repository from the template and clone into it

2. Install the node modules: `npm install`

3. Build the extension in hot-reloading mode with `npm run watch`

4. Install the Quick Extension Reload Extension for easy reloading in development :https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-extension-reload/goeiakeofnlpkioeadcbocfifmgkidpb.

5. Enable extension in the browser:
   1. Type chrome://extensions into the search bar on Chrome (edge://extensions for Edge).
   2. Enable "Developer mode" with top right switch (bottom left on Edge).
   3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension-challenge/dist/` folder.

---

## Usage

1. To continuosly rebuild after code and file changes were saved we execute the following npm script: `npm run watch`

2. Before testing/debugging in the browser we need to refresh the extension in our browser: Press **"Alt" + "R"** when in the browser. (Requires the Quick Extension Reload Extension, see "Installation".)

Note: To apply changes in the code to the extension one could also manually do so by hitting the refresh arrow of the extension at chrome://extensions/.

## Project Structure

The overall project is structured as follows:

      extension-challenge
      ├── dist*
      ├── public
      ├── src
      └── webpack

_\*not checked in_

- **dist:**
  - the build files (once created)
- **public:**
  - all static files for the extension in general, like css and images
- **src:**
  - contains all the source code
- **webpack:**
  - webpack configuration files for development

\
The src folder of the project is structured as follows:

    src
    ├── assets
    ├── tests
    ├── types
    |
    └── main.ts

The subfolders serve the following purpose:

- **assets:**
  - folder containing the project's style files, fonts and images
- **tests:**
  - tests (including end-to-end tests) for the project. Initially empty
- **types:**
  - custom types and interfaces.

And the file:

- **main.ts:**
  - where the magic happens. Main script that runs each time an allowed page is (re)loaded. Technically speaking a contentscript.

## Commands

This is a list of useful commands for the project and a short explanation of what these commands do, when executed in the root folder of the project:

- `npm install` installs the necessary dependencies
- `npm run install:clean` deletes and reinstalls all dependencies
- `npm run watch` continuosly rebuild after code changes
- `npm run test` runs all tests of the project

---

## Tools

This is a list of tools, used in the project

- `Node.js:` runtime environment for JavaScript
- `npm:` package manager for node projects
- `TypeScript:` statically typed programming language, transpiled to JavaScript
- `ESLint:` linter for JavaScript and TypeScript projects
- `Prettier:` code formatter
- `Webpack:` module bundler for JavaScript projects
- `Jest:` testing library for JavaScript projects
